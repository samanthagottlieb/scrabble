![scrabble](https://www.word-grabber.com/3/m/2012/02/scrabble-rack-with-tiles.jpg)

This is a game where players attempt to create words from a set of letter tiles. Different letters have different points allocated to them.

1. Calculate the score for a word. The score is the sum of the points for the letters that make up a word. For example:

GUARDIAN = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Use these points for each letter:

```
- 1 point: E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
- 2 points: D, G
- 3 points: B, C, M, P
- 4 points: F, H, V, W, Y
- 5 points: K
- 8 points: J, X
- 10 points: Q, Z
```

2. Assign seven tiles chosen randomly from the english alphabet to a player's rack.
3. In the real game, tiles are taken at random from a 'bag' containing a fixed number of each tile. Assign seven tiles to a rack using a bag containing this distribution:

```
- 12 tiles: E
- 9 tiles: A,I
- 8 tiles: O
- 6 tiles: N,R,T
- 4 tiles: L,S,U,D
- 3 tiles: G
- 2 tiles: B,C,M,P,F,H,V,W,Y
- 1 tiles: K,J,X,Q,Z
```

4. Find a valid word formed from the seven tiles. A list of valid words can be found in [`dictionary.txt`](./dictionary.txt).
5. Find the longest valid word that can be formed from the seven tiles.
6. Find the highest scoring word that can be formed.
7. Find the highest scoring word if any one of the letters can score triple.
8. For discussion: how would we adapt our solution for a multiplayer environment?
